# Orange Bank Login
This project was made for the technical interview for ING.

The main objectives:

1. Implement the layout: header, mid section, footer. The web page will be used on mobile devices and desktop.
2. Create a web component using LitElement for the login form, use components from lion-web (e.g. lion-input, lion-checkbox). Will contain the following data: OrangeBankID,       CardNumber, SaveCredentials (checkbox).
3. Apply style.
4. To submit the form a submit butoon is clicked. OrangeBankID and CardNumber are required and should contain only alphanumeric characters. Show errors if not.

### Mockup
I made a mockup of the site in Vanilla Html,CSS and JavaScript, you can find it "Form" directory. I made a ".php" file which serve as an "API" to see that I can connect to a database using PHP method.
For the "Save Credentials" I want to store them in the local Store of the Client device, but I know is a **bad** practice, so I will think on other methods.
